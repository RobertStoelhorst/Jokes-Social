# Random Joke Generator

## Project One

### Version 1.0.0

### Deployed to [Heroku](https://murmuring-basin-92750.herokuapp.com/) 

#### Summary
This is my project from our second full project week While studying Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.
Over all it is week six of the course and we have covered HTML & CSS, Js, Dom, Jquery, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and other bits and pieces.

The aim of this project was to build a Frontend and Backend with at least a 3 model database structure, We got to choose our own projects and were given 1 week to deliver.

I choose to build a 3 model database where a user can sign up, create edit and add their own jokes and like other users jokes, Also I used a simple Gem to generate random Dad Jokes from the web and also generate random jokes from the database.

I would like to revisit this project and add one more model where a user can schedule random jokes to be sent to their inbox on a frequency of their choice, why you would want to I don't know, but I know it would be valuable to learn how to build this model, Also I want to set up the database so that different jokes fit into different categories/genres.
